            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Jack Mayerhofer, I am a sophomore and a comp sci major with hopefully a finance double major. I like to play sports like lacrosse, golf and hockey. I also like to snowboard and surf. During the summer I am a surf instructor for kids with special needs. When I graduate I hope to break into the financial world and become a Quant. I also play club lacrosse and am currently rushing fraternities. I also have two brothers, one is my twin and he also goes to UW Madison and one is still in high school. My favorite food is steak and mashed potatoes. Ive only ever traveled out of the country to Canada but I want to study abroad in Europe and hopefully Italy.</p>
